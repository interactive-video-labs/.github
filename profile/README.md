## ✨ What We’re Building

**Interactive Video Player** – an intelligent player that reacts to learner input in real-time.

When the instructor says something like _“for example,”_ a modal appears asking the viewer to select their experience level:
- 🟢 Beginner
- 🔵 Intermediate
- 🔴 Advanced

Based on the selection, the player inserts a relevant example video and then resumes the main lesson — all without switching screens.

---
## 🧠 Key Features

- **Cue-Triggered Modals** – Detects predefined timestamps (or phrases like “for example”) to prompt interaction.
- **Level-Based Examples** – Users choose their experience level, triggering relevant video clips.
- **Seamless Playback** – Example video is inserted and automatically returns to the main timeline.
- **Analytics Logging** – Records user decisions for personalization and progress tracking.

## 💠 Tech Stack

*Not finalized yet.*  
We are currently evaluating the best tools and frameworks for:

- Frontend video interaction and overlays
- Backend API for metadata and playback logic
- Cue detection using speech-to-text or manual timestamps
- Seamless video switching and playback control

💡 Suggestions and contributions are welcome!
