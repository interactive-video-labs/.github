## ✨ What We’re Building

**Interactive Video Player** – an intelligent player that reacts to learner input in real-time.

When the instructor says something like _“for example,”_ a modal appears asking the viewer to select their experience level:
- 🟢 Beginner
- 🔵 Intermediate
- 🔴 Advanced

Based on the selection, the player inserts a relevant example video and then resumes the main lesson — all without switching screens.
